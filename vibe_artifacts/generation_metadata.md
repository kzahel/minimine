# Project Generation Metadata

This project was "vibe coded" using an advanced AI coding assistant.

## Generation Process
- **Method**: Interactive pair programming with an AI agent.
- **Tools**: TypeScript, Vite, Three.js, React.
- **Workflow**:
    1.  **Planning**: The AI analyzed requirements and created an `implementation_plan.md`.
    2.  **Execution**: The AI wrote code, ran builds, and fixed errors iteratively.
    3.  **Verification**: The AI created tests and verified functionality.
    4.  **Tracking**: Progress was tracked in `task.md`.

## Artifacts
The `vibe_artifacts/` directory contains the living documents used during development:
- `task.md`: The checklist of tasks completed.
- `implementation_plan.md`: The technical design and plan.
- `walkthrough.md`: A guide to the implemented features.

## "Vibe Coding"
This term refers to a coding style where the developer guides an AI agent through high-level intent ("vibes") and the agent handles the implementation details, boilerplate, and debugging. This project is a pure example of that workflow.
